# Retro Computer Words REST API

This is a simple REST API EXPRESS app which delivers words (contains 14476 words!) which I've gathered from various 80's Atari computer magazines, articles, reviews and classic computer game title lists.

I created this API in order to use it in my game WordRazer to get random "nerdy" words from this API.

You can query for all words or random words or also add a limit to how many results you want to receive. It is also possible to query for a specific _id.

The api sends back the result in JSON-format.

# Getting started

## Prerequisites

To run this app locally you'll need Node.JS installed. Then just clone it and then run "npm i" to install the dependencies.

### Running the app

In the project directory, you can run:

### `nodemon server.js`

Which launches the server.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
With nodemon you will be able to see any errors in the console.

### Endpoints

#### [GET] api/v1/words/all &#8594; Get all words
#### [GET] api/v1//words/limit/:limit &#8594; Get words by limit [number 1-14476]</p>
#### [GET] api/v1//words/random/all &#8594; Get all words in random order</p>
#### [GET] api/v1//words/random/:limit &#8594; Get random words by limit [number 1-14476]</p>
#### [GET] api/v1/words/id/:id &#8594; Get a specific word by id</p>

### Live URL Test

The API has been deployed to Heroku hosting,

Feel free to use it, at this moment it doesn't need any authentication:
